/**
 * Regression coverage for #1388 — DvrStreamController::stream()/hlsPlaylist()/edl()
 * (direct recording playback/download) previously scoped recordings by `user_id`
 * only, unlike every other direct DVR action which additionally filters by
 * `playlist_auth_id`. That let one guest credential stream, fetch the EDL for,
 * or reach the HLS playlist of another guest's recording on the same playlist
 * just by knowing its UUID. These routes also performed no DVR capability check
 * at all (global config, playlist-level DvrSetting::$enabled).
 *
 * Locks in:
 *   1. A guest credential can stream/edl its own recording.
 *   2. A guest credential cannot stream/edl a sibling credential's recording —
 *      it 404s the same way a non-existent recording would (no existence leak).
 *   3. The playlist owner (owner_auth) retains full visibility across all
 *      credentials' recordings — intentional, mirrors the Xtream DVR actions.
 *   4. Both routes reject when the playlist-level DvrSetting is disabled, or
 *      DVR is disabled globally via config, even for the recording's owner.
